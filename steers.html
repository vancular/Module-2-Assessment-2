                    <h3>STEERS</h3>
                    <p>Steers</p>
                    <p>Steers is one of South Africa’s most recognizable quick-service restaurant brands. The company is well known for serving flame-grilled burgers made from 100% pure beef and handmade chips. Other menu items include chicken burgers, ribs as well as ice cream and milkshakes. </p>
                    <p>In 1983, Steers launched a new franchise programme. The owners placed a single advertisement in a local newspaper inviting franchisees to apply, and since then Steers has never had a shortage of prospective franchisees seeking to buy into the franchise. Within two years there were more than 15 outlets opened, and this number grew to 250 stores ten years later. By the end of the 90s Steers started expanding beyond South Africa’s borders, with outlets in Swaziland, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Mauritius, Zambia, Tanzania and Ivory Coast. There are over 500 franchises across Africa. A Steers restaurant opened on Lavender Hill, Battersea, London, UK in late July 2013.</p>
